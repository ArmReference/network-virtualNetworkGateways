# Resource Notes

## Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways

## APIVersion 2021-05-01

This template defines the properties required to deploy a VirtualNetwork Gateway in Azure.

### Properties

This resource doesn't have a defined properties object, everything is referenced as properties.bgpsettings, this is not an issue just odd, considering the last few I've worked through had a properties object of some sort.
